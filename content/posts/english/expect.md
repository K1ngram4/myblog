## Expect
Expect is usually used when you think a person has a responsibility to do a certain activity, which implies that you hope it will come true.

Someone is expecting something, someone, a package, a certain outcome, etc. and they are somewhat confident that it will happen. If I expect you to join me for lunch, that means that we already made plans to meet up for lunch, and I will be surprised if you don't show up.

Expect是期待的意思。经常用于描述某人因对某事负有责任而推理做出的预测。如果最后没有发生期待的结果或事情，反而让人惊讶。

Examples:

I am expecting the exam result sometime next week. (I am excited for the result, because I did it very well)

I expect to find the room clean by the time I get home. (I hope the room will be clean)

## Anticipate
Anticipate is more like you can guess that someone will likely take a certain action, which implies that you already had known it and you were preparing for (and waiting for) the event to happen.

If you anticipate that something will happen, it means that you suspect it MIGHT happen. Anticipation involves a lot more speculation.

Anticipate是预计预期的意思。暗示对于事情的发展变化提前已经有所掌握，猜测大概率会是正确的。

Examples:

The concert on Tuesday is highly anticipated and is discussing widely on social media. (People are very excited for the concert)

I anticipate he will clean the room by the time I get home. (the room will be cleaned probably. I am not surprised if I won’t be cleaned)

## Predict
Predict implies don't know what time the event will happen. Generally, it sounds like it's simply the person's opinion.

Predict是预测的意思。通常是指一个人根据自己的经验或其他的知识预测某件事可能会发生。

Examples:

The weather didn't turn out as rainy as the newspaper article predicted.

## Forecast
Forecast is a subset of prediction, and it's based on time-series data. So, all forecast are predictions, but not all predictions are forecast. It is usually only for money and weather scenarios. Because correct weather and money predictions base on temporal time-series information.

Forecast也是预测的意思。但强调的是基于历史数据的预测。是Predict的子集。

Examples:

The company’s sales forecast looks very good.

The forecaster forecasts it will rain this weekend.
